    <b>About Me</b>
    <p>After graduating college, I worked for four years as a middle school English teacher. I mentored several college students, who visited my class regularly. Additionally, I also wrote my own curriculum for two classes. Teaching was a stressful blast every day. Currently, I'm pursuing a master's in Technical Communication and Rhetoric with the goal of working as a technical writer. In my freetime, I read or practice piano or tennis.</p>
